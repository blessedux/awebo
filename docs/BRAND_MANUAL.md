# AWEBO

## Brand Manual

## Brand Background

AWEBO exists because culture has outgrown campaigns.

In today’s launch economy, brands are expected to perform constantly—posting, hyping, narrating—just to remain visible. Infrastructure is treated as an afterthought, and culture is reduced to aesthetics instead of treated as an asset.

AWEBO takes the opposite position.

We are not a megaphone. We are a system.

AWEBO is a launchpad for culture-backed brands: a single, scalable infrastructure that unifies tokens, physical merchandise, and global logistics. We enable designers and studios to design once, launch globally, and earn programmatically—without reinventing distribution every time.

Where others optimize for attention, AWEBO optimizes for durability.

Culture is not noise. It compounds.

---

## Design Ethos

Good design is not loud.

It selects. It frames. It amplifies what matters.

AWEBO’s design language is built around restraint and precision. Every element earns its place. Interfaces are calm, spatial, and deliberate—designed to feel closer to infrastructure than marketing.

We believe clarity outperforms hype.

Helpful design is not invisible, but it never begs for attention. It stands where it needs to be found.

---

## Find Your Way

AWEBO serves designers, creators, cultural brands, and Web3-native studios operating across borders by default.

Our visual system must guide without overwhelming. It must allow multiple audiences—founders, collectors, partners—to navigate the same surface with different intentions.

Design becomes orientation.

If you are here to build, the system opens.
If you are here to collect, the signal sharpens.
If you are here to scale, the infrastructure reveals itself.

## Brand Logo

The AWEBO logo is a mark of infrastructure.

It does not behave like a campaign asset, nor like a decorative emblem. It signals reliability, authorship, and permanence. When present, it should feel inevitable rather than expressive.

The logo must never compete for attention. It anchors the composition and allows the rest of the system to operate around it.

### Brand Logos

AWEBO maintains a primary wordmark and supporting logo variants intended for different environments. All official logos are optically balanced and must never be altered, redrawn, or stylized.

Usage principles:

- Use the primary logo whenever possible.
- Avoid excessive scaling.
- Never apply effects, shadows, gradients, or outlines.
- Never rotate or distort.

The logo represents the system. Treat it as such.

### Construction and Clear Space

Clear space preserves the authority of the AWEBO logo.

A minimum exclusion zone must surround the logo at all times. This space is measured relative to the height of the logotype and ensures legibility, hierarchy, and compositional calm.

No other elements—typography, imagery, UI components, or decorative marks—may enter this space.

Negative space is not empty. It is structural.

---

## Typography

Typography is the primary interface between AWEBO and its users.

Words must feel measured, neutral, and deliberate. Typography should never feel promotional, expressive, or playful. We design for longevity, not moments.

AWEBO uses sans-serif typography exclusively.

### Headline Brand

Headlines are sentence-case and spacious. They carry meaning without urgency.

Preferred typefaces:

- Inter
- Neue Montreal
- Söhne

Headlines should feel architectural—clear spans of information that establish structure before detail.

Avoid aggressive weights, excessive contrast, or overly condensed styles.

### Supporting Fonts

Subheads and body copy support comprehension.

Hierarchy is achieved through spacing, scale, and rhythm rather than decoration. The reader should never feel pushed.

### Main Font Types

- Headlines: Large, sentence-case, neutral weight
- Subheads: Restrained, informational
- Body copy: Highly readable, calm, globally legible

Typography must respect the reader’s attention. If text feels like marketing, it is incorrect.

### Scale

AWEBO typography follows a clear information funnel.

Large text establishes context.
Smaller text delivers precision.

Scale is used to guide understanding—not to dramatize content.

### Readability Guidelines

- Do not overload headlines.
- If a message requires explanation, move it to body copy.
- Allow generous line spacing.
- Favor clarity over density.

## Color Palette

AWEBO’s color system is cold, cinematic, and infrastructural.

Color is used to orient, differentiate, and stabilize interfaces—not to decorate them.

### Color Hierarchy

Deep Polar Blue is the primary brand anchor.

Absolute Black provides authority and contrast.

Secondary tones structure the interface and provide depth without noise.

### Primary Color Palette

- Deep Polar Blue — primary brand surfaces, headers, hero areas
- Absolute Black — text, contrast, authority

These colors should dominate the visual field.

### Secondary Color Palette

- Slate Blue-Grey — cards, UI containers, structural elements
- Glacial Light Blue — accents, buttons, highlights
- Midnight Teal — navigation, footers, depth layers

Secondary colors support orientation. They should never overpower the primary palette.

---

## Highlights and Emphasis

AWEBO avoids decorative emphasis.

When emphasis is required, it is precise and restrained.

Highlights are used to:

- Signal interaction
- Mark state changes
- Indicate importance without urgency

Emphasis should feel structural, not expressive.

---

## Photography and Media

AWEBO does not rely on aspirational imagery.

Media should feel real, grounded, and global. We show creators, objects, logistics, and artifacts—not fantasies.

Photography should:

- Feel observational, not staged
- Capture texture, scale, and materiality
- Avoid clichés of “startup culture”

Distance is avoided. Images should feel present.

Imperfection is acceptable if it adds truth.

---

## Layout System

AWEBO layouts prioritize structure and legibility.

A consistent grid system governs all compositions. Alignment is strict. Spacing is generous.

From start to finish:

1. Place the logo first
2. Establish headline alignment
3. Introduce body copy
4. Add secondary color structure
5. Introduce media only when it adds information

Layouts should feel inevitable, not composed.

---

## Illustration and Iconography

Illustration is used sparingly.

When employed, it replaces text—not decorates it.

Illustrations should be literal, structural, and readable from distance. Avoid metaphor unless it clarifies faster than words.

Icons follow the same principles:

- Be literal
- Leverage convention
- Communicate instantly

If an illustration requires explanation, it has failed.

---

## Motion Graphics

Motion in AWEBO is slow, subtle, and purposeful.

Transitions feel like wind—not fireworks.

Animation is only introduced when it improves comprehension or orientation. Never animate for novelty.

Motion should:

- Reinforce structure
- Respect pacing
- Feel infrastructural

---

## Digital

AWEBO is digital by default.

Interfaces are calm, spacious, and deliberate. Negative space is a functional element.

This manual defines principles that extend into a dedicated digital design system.

---

## Tone of Voice

AWEBO speaks like infrastructure.

The tone is measured, confident, and precise. We avoid hype, urgency, and superlatives.

We do not persuade. We explain.

Language reflects systems thinking—clear inputs, clear outputs.

### Writing Principles

- Lead with clarity
- Respect attention
- Avoid theatrical language
- Be globally intelligible

AWEBO’s voice sits at the intersection of:

- Gumroad’s clarity
- Big Cartel’s independence
- Merchbar’s operational confidence

Calm. Professional. Unshakeable.

---

## Brand Architecture and Naming

AWEBO is always the primary brand.

Products, tools, and initiatives function as extensions of the system.

Examples:

- AWEBO Core
- AWEBO Drops
- AWEBO Merch

Naming should be descriptive, not clever.

Consistency builds trust.

---

## Closing

AWEBO is not a platform built for moments.

It is infrastructure built for creators who intend to last.
